  ## Description
  This is for Challenge 13 of the Coding Bootcamp
  
  ## Installation
  Start by running "npm i" in your terminal to get all the right packages. From there you will need to start up mysql and source 'db/schema.sql. After you have done that, you can quit out of mysql and run 'npm run seed' to get all the dummy data to start the application. Once all of that is done, you can run the command 'npm start'. You will need to have insomnia or some type of program that will let you run GET, POST, PUT and DELETE commands.
